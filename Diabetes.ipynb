    "- A: Number of pregnancies\n",
    "- B: Concentration of plasma glucose in a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test\n",
    "- C: Diastolic blood pressure - Measured in mmHg\n",
    "- D: Triceps skin fold thickness - Measured in mm\n",
    "- E: Insulin concentration in the serum in 2 hours. Measured in (mu U/ml)\n",
    "- F: Weight in kg/height in (m^2)\n",
    "- G: Function that assigns the probability of someone getting diabetes\n",
    "- H: Age\n",
    "- Target: Value of 0 or 1 corresponds to no diabetes and diabetes\n",

    "### Devliverable\n",
    "Submit the iPython notebook or the .py file of your work. Also, you should submit the csv file of the prediction. \n",

    "### Exam rules\n",
    "You can use only the machine learning models discussed in Course Module 3. If the prediction is based on a model that is not discussed in class, one of the models in your submission will randomly be selected for grading. Fifty percent of the grade is based on your Python code submission. The following rubric will be used for grading. The other 50 percent of your grade is based on the accuracy of the prediction. \n",
